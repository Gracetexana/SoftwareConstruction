# Software Construction

## Taught by Professor Amal Chaaben at Rochester Institute of Technology

I enrolled in this course during my first semester at RIT from January 2023 to May 2023. We worked enirely with Java, except for one assignment that integrated Java and SQL. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the specific instructions for the assignments besides Homework 1, which are shown below. This has been a lesson in staying up to date with my GitHub repositories instead of trying to update them 6 months later. Primarily, I wanted evidence of my ability to code in Java.

#### [Homework 1](homework01-Gracetexana):  

- [Problem 1](homework01-Gracetexana/Carroll.java)  
  >Create a class that, when executed, it prints the following quote line-by-line (note that the ' d ' in the
word ' and ' and the last ' l ' in the word ' Carroll ' appear in the same column):
  >
  >     "Begin at the
  >     beginning,", the King
  >     said, very gravely, "and
  >     go on till you come to
  >     the end: then stop."
  >               -Lewis Carroll

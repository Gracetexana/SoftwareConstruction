The root cause on the left side is that array a is longer than array b. int i counts up until the end of array a, but if a is longer than b, i goes past the last index of b.
Dog d's name is null, so calling d.name.equals(this.name) throws a NullPointerException because there is nothing for d.name to refer to.
